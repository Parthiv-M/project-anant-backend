# Project Anant
aNANt is an initiative of Materials Theory and Simulations Group, Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, to develop and host an open-access online repository of functional materials. aNANt database shares the structures and electronic properties of computationally designed two-dimensional functional materials in a single platform. Currently, it hosts over 23,000 materials data. 
This is the version two of the web application, and the first one could be found [here](https://github.com/rohith-kms/aNANt-dev/tree/main/aNANt).
